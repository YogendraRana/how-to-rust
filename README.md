## How To Rust

Welcome everyone! This is where I document my journey as I dive into the world of Rust programming. Whether you're a fellow Rust enthusiast or just curious about what Rust has to offer, you've come to the right place.

In this repository, you'll find a collection of code examples, projects, and resources that I've gathered along the way. I'll be sharing my progress, insights, and lessons learned as I explore Rust's unique features, its strong focus on safety, and its thriving community.

Feel free to explore the code, offer feedback, or even join me on this exciting journey of Rust discovery. Together, we can unlock the power and potential of this modern systems programming language.

Happy coding!
